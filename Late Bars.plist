		<key>pubBlurb</key>
		<string>The secret&apos;s out, but it doesn&apos;t spoil the intrigue. This is one for those that don&apos;t mind tight spaces, as the pub is small and the demand is large. The front is unassuming, but inside there are sumptious couches to enjoy (if you can get one), and a large smoking section out back. A professional bar staff, a lively urban crowd, and an odd snail as a logo.</string>

		<string>30 Bachelors Walk, Dublin 1</string>
		<key>pubBlurb</key>
		<string>Located right on the banks of the Liffey, this place should definitely not be judged by its exterior appearance. The interior is striking, if a little cosy, with low vaulted ceilings and a bridge over the basement floor. Seating can be hard to come by, but the friendly atmosphere should more than make up for it.</string>

		<string>18 Camden Street Lower, Dublin 2</string>
		<key>pubBlurb</key>
		<string>The name says it all - Here. This is one of those cosmopolitan gems that make the Dublin pub scene so memorable. The decor is very much low key, the selection of local brews very well considered, and the weekend DJ selections ensure a lively energetic night out. Don&apos;t expect a lot of personal space on a weekend, but you&apos;ll be part of a great atmosphere! Also hosts a comedy club on a Wednesday.</string>

		<string>The Oak looks an innocent little pub from the street, but once you get inside and downstairs you&apos;ll find a hopping night spot, full of a mish-mash of happy people dancing and singing to a wide variety of (mostly) indie anthems. Be warned, Metallica may be dropped towards the end of the night.</string>

		<string>Sinnotts is a cavernous bar, with high ceilings and high spirits. Good sport, beer and pub food flow throughout the day and at night, the bar transforms into a buzzing hive of energy. The location makes Sinnnots especially ideal for some welcome refreshment from a day's shopping - or just an excuse to party.</string>

		<string>Doyles is a very quiet pub during the afternoon, but gets pretty busy on weekend nights. It&apos;s very much a traditional dublin pub, with late opening 7 nights and basic bar food till early evening. The adjoining Bowes Bar hosts trad sessions on a Sunday.</string>

		<string>The PorterHouse Central is a sister pub of the original PorterHouse in Temple Bar. Central offers the same unique range of beers brewed by the company, with occasional guest beers as well. Unlike the original, Central offers wide open spaces, all on the same floor, which means the atmosphere is more charged once the music picks up. DJs and late openings all weekend. </string>
