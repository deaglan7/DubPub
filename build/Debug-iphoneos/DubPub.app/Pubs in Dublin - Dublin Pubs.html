                  <ul>
                      <li><strong> The Auld Dubliner</strong> - 


 One of the temple bar 'traditional' tourist bars. Always good craic in the temple bar kind of way, with mixed crowds and live music occasionally.                      
                      <li><strong> The Boars Head</strong> - 


 A tiny little bar located on Capel St. Has a nice atmosphere and good for a few pints and a chat. It is very small though                      
                      <li><strong> The Brazen Head </strong>- 


 The oldest pub in Dublin, and possibly Ireland and Europe, which supposedly dates back to the 12th century. Very much a tourist haunt now, though you will find all sorts. Located on Bridge St, about a ten minute walk down the South Quays.                      
                      <li> <strong>Brogans   -</strong> Brogans is a nice relaxing pub located on Dame St, perfect for a few relaxed pints. Located right next door to the Olympia. Very mixed crowd.                      
                      <li><strong> The Dame Tavern</strong>   - 


 A tiny little pub located off the beaten track behind Dame Street on Dame lane. A really friendly and lively little pub with live music most nights. Does get very crowded but great craic.                      
                      <li> <strong>Doyles</strong>  - 


 A decent, quiet, out of the way pub which is good for a few pints. Located on College Green.                      
                      <li> <strong>The Firestone </strong>- 


 Used to be the Plough, this is a real traditional Dublin, if not Irish, pub. Has live music most nights and a very mixed crowd. Located across from the Abbey theatre you can occasionally spot the odd actor in for a pint.</li>
                    <li><strong> The Foggy Dew

</strong> - 


 Popular bar in temple bar just beside the central bank, which is always a good place to visit and with a very mixed crowd.                    
                    <li><strong> The Ha'penny Bridge Inn </strong>- 


 Like the Dame Tavern, the Ha'Penny is another of Dublin's great little pubs. Always good craic with entertainment including an open mic comedy night on tuesdays. Not the best decorated of pubs, but well worth a visit.                    
                    <li><strong> Johnnie Fox's Pub

</strong>- Way Way Way off the beaten track (located in the Dublin Mountains) this had to be included as its one of Dublin's most famous pubs. Has different types of live music and dancing on different nights. Well worth a visit at least once. Costs about &euro;25 in a taxi from the city centre.                    
                    <li><strong> The Long Stone  -</strong> 
 A nice pub located just beside Trinity College, it obviously attracts a lot of students. A good place for a few drinks, but seats can be at a premium.
                    <li>  <strong>Messrs Maguires</strong>  - 


 Spanning four floors and has its own brewery, offering its own beers as well as the usual suspects. Always seems to be packed and a pretty good night out.
                    <li><strong> O'Neills</strong> - 


 A very popular pub located on Suffolk St in the city centre. Nice place for a few pints and a friendly atmosphere.
                    <li><strong> The Thomas Read </strong>- 


 A very nice relaxed pub which is larger than it looks, can be a good night out with mostly rock / indie music.</li>
                    </ul>
